# ProjectDS1: Collaborative Static Website Development

## Overview

This project is a collaborative effort to develop a static website using Git and GitHub. The primary goal is to gain practical experience with version control workflows, branching, merging, and conflict resolution. The website itself will be intentionally simple, focusing on the Git process rather than complex web development.

## Team Members

*   Penli911gt 
*   Saif9667
*   Chraki007
*   Ghayth233

## Project Goals

*   Successfully create and manage branches for different features.
*   Implement basic HTML and CSS for the websiteâ€™s structure and styling.
*   Understand and resolve merge conflicts.
*   Demonstrate proficiency in Git commands (init, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge).
*   Document the entire process.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   Git
*   GitHub

## Workflow

The project follows a branching workflow:

1.  Main Branch: The primary branch containing the stable version of the website.
2.  Feature Branches: Individual branches created for implementing new features or making changes.
3.  Pull Requests: Used to propose changes from feature branches to the main branch.

## Key Git Commands

Throughout the project, we will be using the following Git commands:

*   `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
*   `git add`: Stages changes for commit.
*   `git commit`: Records changes to the repository.
*   `git push`: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.
*   `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
*   `git branch`: Creates, lists, or deletes branches.
*   `git merge`: Joins two or more development histories together.

## Learning Experience

This project is designed to be a learning experience, even if it means deliberately creating merge conflicts to understand how to resolve them. Documentation and communication are key to success.
